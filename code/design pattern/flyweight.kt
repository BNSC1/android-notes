/*
1. Divide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into two parts:
- the intrinsic state (color): the fields that contain unchanging data duplicated across many objects
- the extrinsic state (coordinate): the fields that contain contextual data unique to each object
*/

/*
2. Leave the fields that represent the intrinsic state in the class, but make sure theyâ€™re immutable.
   They should take their initial values only inside the constructor.
*/
data class Color(val red: Int, val green: Int, val blue: Int)
data class GrassAppearance(val textures: String, val color: Color)

/*
3. Go over methods that use fields of the extrinsic state.
   For each field used in the method, introduce a new parameter and use it instead of the field.
*/
class Grass(val x: Int, val y: Int, val appearance: GrassAppearance) {
    fun draw() {
        println("Grass at ($x,$y) with color R:${appearance.color.red}, G:${appearance.color.green}, B:${appearance.color.blue}")
    }
}

/*
4. Optionally, create a factory class to manage the pool of flyweights.
   It should check for an existing flyweight before creating a new one.
   Once the factory is in place, clients must only request flyweights through it.
   They should describe the desired flyweight by passing its intrinsic state to the factory.
